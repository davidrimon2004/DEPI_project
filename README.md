# Sales Forecasting and Demand Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project is the **graduation project of the Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)** offered by **MCIT, Egypt**.  
It builds a machine learning model to predict **future sales and demand** using historical data and external factors (seasonality, promotions, holidays).  
The goal is to help businesses optimize **inventory, staffing, and marketing strategies**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Collect and preprocess sales data  
- Explore sales patterns, seasonality, and external factors  
- Build and compare forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet, Random Forest, LSTM)  
- Evaluate using MAE, RMSE, R²  
- Deploy the best model with MLOps for monitoring and retraining
