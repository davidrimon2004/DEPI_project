The\ngoal is to analyse historical patterns and generate reliable forecasts that help\nbusinesses make data-driven decisions to reduce costs, increase efficiency, and\nimprove customer satisfaction by predicting the daily sales for the next 28 days.\n\n## Objectives\n\n● Collect and preprocess historical sales and demand data.\n\n● Identify key features that influence sales trends.\n\n● Build, train, and optimise forecasting models to predict future sales and\ndemand.\n\n● Deploy the best-performing model to generate forecasts in real-time or in\nbatches.\n## Data source:\nHierarchical
